#Simple AngularJS CRUD app

##About

My first attempts in developing with AngularJS framework nothing much exciting here.
This project is a simple web-application that manages data on remote server with RESTful API.
The app itself pursuit educational goals. It should show some basic AngularJS aspects in action.

- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations via Ajax
- Integration with Bootstrap via UI Bootstrap (AngularJS implementation of Bootstrap)
- Form validation

- [x] Add a modal for creating/updating of an item
- [ ] Error handling
