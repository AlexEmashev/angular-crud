#Simple AngularJS CRUD app

##About

My first attempts in developing with AngularJS framework nothing much exciting here.
This project is a simple web-application that manages data on remote server with RESTful API.
The app itself pursuit educational goals. It should show some basic AngularJS aspects in action.

##Features

- Remote data display
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations via Ajax
- Integration with Bootstrap via UI Bootstrap (AngularJS implementation of Bootstrap)
- Form validation

##Used libraries

- AngularJS v1.4.7
- Bootstrap v3.3.5

##ToDo

This is a very early stage. So there are plenty things to do.

- [x] List remote data in table
- [ ] Write CRUD operations code
- [ ] Add a modal for creating/updating of an item
- [ ] Replace new method implementation with actual ajax call
