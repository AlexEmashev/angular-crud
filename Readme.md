My first attempts in developing with AngularJS framework nothing much exciting here.
This project is a simple web-application that manages data on remote server with RESTful API.

App can perform CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

##ToDo
This is a very early stage. So there are plenty things to do.
